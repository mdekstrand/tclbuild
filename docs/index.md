# Introduction

This site provides access to various things I have put together to make my life
with TCL easier; in particular, management of my shell environment (using a
stripped-down Jim), but also some additional system automation tasks.  These
include:

- Precompiled binaries for a variety of platforms.
- A small library of comfort utilities and bits from the Web, most of which work in Jim.
